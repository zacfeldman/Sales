# LeaseHub Sales Playbook

## Sales Book

This guide is intended to help with the sales process and guide you through the journey of onboarding a new client.

## [First Contact](first-contact.md)

This will guide you in making contact with your new Lead.

Your First contact may be a phone call, email or even a quick meeting or chat.

It may be that your first contact is also the [The Demo](the-demo.md)  In that case you will just need to assess how much time there is and if you need to show more of the software and less of discussion or visa versa.
