# The Quote

## Per Lease

Leasehub charges a per lease fee for each and every residential lease. This is for the **Generation** of the document and not for having a tenant in the property.&#x20;

The charge per lease is usually a number that managing agents can build into their lease admin fees that the tenant pays. This way the cost of the lease is passed onto the tenant and allows more managing agents to use LeaseHub.&#x20;

For landlord this cost is more significant as they do not always pass on the cost to the tenant. However, the landlord has a far greater risk of not onboarding new tenants and therefore is usually not deterred by this cost.&#x20;

There is usually a minimum of **50** leases per month in order for the deployment to be worth it. We are currently working on a tenanted environment to allow for smaller agents to use this software.&#x20;

## Per Application

The charge per application is for all application regardless of application status. If you want to give a discount for converted leases and only charge for unsuccessful applications this is done by discounting the value of the per lease to be the per lease charge less the application charge. This is usualy done for large clients only with a minimum of 200 leases per month.&#x20;

## SLA

Leasehub is designed to have a built in SLA. However, for tenants that are doing less than 200 leases minimum per month on Leashub this cost is no longer covered. Therefore, it is recommended that the SLA be charged for all clients with less than 200 leases per month.&#x20;

Moreover, the SLA should be discounted 100% for tenants with over 200 leases per month in order to show the amount of hours they are entitled to and what that covers.&#x20;
