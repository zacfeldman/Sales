## What kind of rentals do you focus on?

### Types of Rentals

#### Residential leases

Residential leases are the LeaseHub main focus. A residential lease follows a standard workflow process with limited variations.

#### Commercial Leases

These leases can be accommodated on LeaseHub but since the clause negotiation element and contract annotation have not yet been built into LeaseHub this will usually be standard leases with little complexity.

#### Retail Leases

Like commercial leases, retail leases can be accommodated with simple leases but **Anchor Tenants** such as _Woolworths_ or _Pick and Pay_ will want to use their own leases and therefore cannot be done with LeaseHub.

## Are you the landlord?

If the Property Manager **is** also the landlord the primary concern will be to streamline the entire process and allow them to get tenants to move in as quickly as possible.

However, if the Property manager is an agent only and **not the landlord** the primary goal will be to reduce costs and increase leases signed per month. Each agent productivity can therefore be increased with LeaseHub.

Since the cost of LeaseHub is per application and per lease, it is vital to show that the value that the agent is getting here will allow them to increase sales. In most cases, the agent charges the landlord per lease. If the agent does not want to absorb the cost of they software they can add the LeaseHub fee to the **lease admin fee** and pass the cost on to the tenant.

## What is your LSM?

LSM - Living Standards Measure

This will determine what the cost of each lease and indicate if the Property manager is dealing with high volumes and low value leases or visa versa.

## Do you use MDA?

Most Property management companies use MDA which is backend financial management software tailored towards the Property industry.&#x20;

This is software acquired recently by American company _MRI_ that has a locked down API.&#x20;

We are currently using _RPA_ technology such as [Microsoft Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/robotic-process-automation/) to import this data into RPA in order to integrate.&#x20;

### _PayProp_ and Others

There are other software companies that can do the same job as MDA/MRI and we can integrate with these depending on the APIs available as well as imports.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Important: We do not compete with e software as LeaseHub is not a financial system and does not intend to compete. Rather we work together to give a smooth and wholistic experience.
{% endhint %}



## Credit Bureau&#x20;

### TPN

Most clients use TPN as the credit bureau. we have integrated with them and we do automated credit checks from TPN and we use the _TPN\_RentCheck_ which includes the TPN 7 in 1 check. There are 3 _Credex_ options which TPN use:

* Gold
* Silver
* Basic

{% hint style="info" %}
Gold Credex does a full affordability assessment. It is therefore vital that income and rent are correct as these will be used to assess affordability.
{% endhint %}

### Experian and Transunion

We currently do not integrate&#x20;
