## Start the Demo

Begin with the Landing page. Each element of the landing page can talk to a different need within a company.&#x20;

### Focus Area

The focus area is is used by management to identify key buildings that they want agents to focus on that month.

Landlords may not find this particularly useful and therefore the audience should be considered when spending time on this feature.&#x20;

### Favorites

Favorites are used to mark items that are needed often that you are working on at the moment. These can be various documents depending on the users roles. Some examples of these are&#x20;

1. Leases
2. applications&#x20;
3. Proof of payments
4. contact sheets
5. TPN reports&#x20;

### Dashboard

The dashboards are configurable and can change as per the clients requirements. Any dashboard from the management dashboards  can be configured onto the landing page.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The dashboards are permission based and therefore  agents will only see the data that they can see whereas management will see the entire portfolio&#x20;
